# 📊 Online Retail Sales & Product Analytics Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built using the **Online Retail II** dataset. The dashboard provides insights into customer behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends for an e-commerce platform.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This Power BI project was developed during a data analytics internship to demonstrate the ability to turn raw transactional data into meaningful business insights. The dashboard is divided into two pages:

1. **Executive Summary**  
   - High-level KPIs: Total Revenue, Number of Invoices, Unique Customers  
   - Monthly sales trends  
   - Top countries by sales  
   - Interactive slicers for time period and location

2. **Product Analytics**  
   - Top 10 Products by Revenue and Quantity Sold  
   - Revenue vs Quantity Scatter Plot by Country  
   - Product Price Distribution  
   - Interactive filters for Product, Country, Price, and Customer ID

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling and visualization  
- **Excel** – Dataset source (.xlsx)  
- **DAX** – Calculated columns and custom measures

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Online Retail II Dataset – UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II)  
- Contains transactional data for an online UK-based retailer from 2009–2011.

## ⚙️ Features Implemented

- Custom measures (e.g., `TotalPrice = Quantity * UnitPrice`)  
- Data cleaning and transformation in Power BI  
- Page-level and visual-level filters  
- Slicers for dynamic interactivity  
- Clear, dark-themed visual layout for enhanced readability

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data visualization using Power BI to derive actionable insights from raw retail data. It highlights key competencies in data analysis, dashboard design, and storytelling.
